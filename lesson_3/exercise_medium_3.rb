# Question 1
  # Confusion
# Question 2
  # All
# Question 3
  # my_string remains the same, '+=' does NOT mutate the caller
  # << however, does. So my_array gets changed
# Question 4
  # my_string becomes "rutabaga", because method 'gsub!' mutates the caller
  # as sugested by '!' at the end of method name
  # my_array remains the same, since asignment does not mutate the caller
# Question 5
  # def color_valid(color)
  #  color == "blue" || color == "green"
  # end

  # ruby automatically evaluates the expression, and returns it's value
