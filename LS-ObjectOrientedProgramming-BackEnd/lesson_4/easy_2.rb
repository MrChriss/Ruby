# Question 1
# it will randomly print a sentence to the screen.

# Question 2
# RoadTrip's instance method ``choices`` will override
# superclass' instance method ``choices``
# therefore it will print a random sentence, generated from
# the array, returned by method choices of class RoadTrip

# Question 3
# to find the ancestors of a class, use .ancestors instance metod of class
# Module, it will return Ruby's lookup path.

# Question 4
# to replace two redundant methods, we could use ``attr_accessor`` method.

# Question 5
# there are local variable, instance variable and class variable.
# we can see that by looking at the prefix in the variable name.

# Question 6
# here we have two methods; one is instance method and the other is a class
# method.
# class methods start with ``self``
# to call a class method use ClassName.method_name

# Question 7
# in this case, the class variable, @@cats_count
# is incrementen by 1 in the initialize method, which is called
# every time .new method is called.
# it counts the number of Cat instances created.

# Question 8
# if we want a class to inherit from another class we use ``<``
# like this ``SubClass < SuperClass``

# Question 9
# if we create a new instance method in a sub-class
# that already exsists in super-class, and call it on an instance of the
# sub-class, it will call the instance method defined in the sub-class.
# sub-class' method will override super-class' instace method.

# Question 10
# some of the benefits of the OOP are:
# allowing the programmer to think more abstractly
# objects are easier to conceptualize
# solving some namespace issues
# less duplication
# faster development of programs, due to code re-usage
# easier managment of program's complexity
